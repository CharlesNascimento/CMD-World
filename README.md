# Memory Game
CMD World is a platform game written in Pascal and made only with ASCII characters in a command console. Many aspects of a game were implemented, like gravity, collision detection, rendering, update, input, character control and more. The game contains a total of 10 levels, in which the player must collect a key to open a door in order to finish the level. But it is not as simple as it seems to be, actually it is a pretty hard game. One will probably die dozens of times in order to complete it. Having that in mind, I even implemented a state saving/loading functionally for the less patient players.
